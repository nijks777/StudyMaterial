What is "Gradient Descent"?

Explain how a Logistic Regression model works (e.g., how does it differ from Linear Regression?).

What is an Activation Function (like ReLU or Sigmoid) in a neural network?

How do you handle missing or null values in a dataset?

What is the difference between "Bagging" and "Boosting"?

What is a Support Vector Machine (SVM)?

What is "One-Hot Encoding," and when is it used?

[Scenario] Your model performs with 98% accuracy on the training set but only 70% on the test set. What is this problem called, and what are three ways you could try to fix it?

What is the difference between a "validation set" and a "test set"?

What is the "Curse of Dimensionality"?

What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and what kind of problems is it best suited for?

What is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and what is its main advantage over a standard feed-forward network?

What is TF-IDF?

What are LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units)? How do they improve upon basic RNNs?

What is "Transfer Learning"?

[Scenario] How would you design a system to detect and filter spam comments on a website in real-time? (This tests the full lifecycle: data collection, feature engineering, model choice, and deployment).

What are the key assumptions of Linear Regression? What happens if they are violated?

What is "model drift" or "concept drift," and how would you monitor for it in a production environment?

[Scenario] A client wants you to build a model to predict stock prices. What are the major challenges, and what would you tell the client about the feasibility?
