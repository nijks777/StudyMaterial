Easy (5)

What is Agentic AI and how is it different from a standard LLM chatbot?

What are tools (or skills) in AI agents, and why are they needed?

Explain the difference between Reactive Agents and Proactive / Planning Agents.

What is an Agent Loop (perceive → reason → act → refine)?

Scenario: You want an agent to schedule a meeting. What minimum capabilities does it need?

Medium (15)

Describe how LLMs enable reasoning abilities in AI agents.

What is tool calling, and how do agents decide when to call an external function?

Explain memory in agent systems (short-term vs long-term). Give typical storage options.

What are stateful vs stateless agents? When would you prefer each?

Scenario: Your agent is stuck in a reasoning loop repeating the same action. What debugging steps do you take?

How do frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and AutoGen support agent orchestration?

Contrast single-agent systems vs multi-agent collaboration.

What is Task Planning, and how do agents break goals into sub-tasks?

Explain how ReAct (Reason + Act) prompting improves agent execution.

Scenario: Your agent uses the correct tools but still produces wrong results. Identify possible root causes.

What role do embeddings & vector search play in multi-step agent workflows?

How do agents determine the sequence of actions needed to complete a complex task?

What is explicit reward feedback vs self-reflection feedback in agent improvement loops?

How can agents be made persistent across sessions? Mention data storage & retrieval approaches.

Scenario: A multi-agent system is arguing or conflicting in decisions. How do you resolve coordination / arbitration?

Explain the importance of guardrails, policies, and execution sandboxes in Agentic AI.

Difficult (5)

Deep Dive: Compare ReAct, Chain-of-Thought Planning, and Tree-of-Thought search strategies for agent decision-making.

Scenario: You must deploy an enterprise agent with access to internal systems (emails, ERP, CRM). Outline a secure architecture with auditability.

Explain how agent simulators (e.g., multi-agent social simulations) are being used for economic, product, and behavior modeling.

Describe the challenge of hallucination in agents and how hybrid symbolic + neural reasoning can reduce it.

Scenario: A financial-trading agent must autonomously trade, learn from outcomes, and avoid catastrophic losses. Discuss:

Risk constraints

Human override

Continuous monitoring

Regulatory compliance

Ethical guardrails
